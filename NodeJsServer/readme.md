# Loo Api Server

## Description
This Loo Api Server is for getting, posting and updating loo data on a mongodb

## Test it locally

### Get, install and run mongoDb
To test the Loo Server you have to download and install MongoDb for your platform. Use  `https://www.mongodb.com/try/download` and choose the on premise version.
In the best case you download the mondoDb Compass as well: `https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass`
With the mongoDb Compass you get a GUI to have a look inside your mongoDb.
After that you can run it.

### install node.js and run the server
Go to `https://nodejs.org/de/download/` and download and install node.js for your operating system.
Test if the installation worked with `node -v` or `npm -v` in your terminal or powershell

If everything is fine navigate to the `NodeJsServer` project folder an run: `npm install`. You should see a folder named `node_modules` afterwards.
Then you can run `node index` to start the application.
You should see: You started the server on port 8080 If you can see this everything works fine!
showing up on your terminal or powershell.
